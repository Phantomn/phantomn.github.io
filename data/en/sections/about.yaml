# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate Vulnerability Researcher and Developer with experience in cybersecurity automation and AI system design. I built OSS tools and fuzzers for embedded systems (e.g., PLCs, HMIs) aligned with [IEC 62443-4-2](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/iec-62443). I also design automation workflows with [n8n](https://n8n.io/), build custom RAG pipelines. Sometimes, I work on fun projects like reverse engineering obfuscated scripts or creating structured knowledge systems.'
